# Mushroom Farm Project Overview

> Location: Darwin, Australia
> Scale: 20-50kg/week (starting at 5kg/week)
> Philosophy: "Small Giants" - intentionally small, excellence over growth

---

## Vision & Strategy

### Why This Project

1. **Diversification** - Building multiple income streams (software + physical production)
2. **Resilience** - Tangible, local capability that provides optionality regardless of economic/technological shifts
3. **Meaningful Work** - Direct connection between effort and output, community ties, real product

### The "Small Giants" Approach

Staying intentionally small until systems are dialed in. Not chasing growth for growth's sake. Optimize for:
- Operational simplicity
- Quality over quantity
- Sustainable one-person workload
- Profitability at small scale

## Infrastructure

### Current Status

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Growing experience | Complete (tent growing done) |
| Lab | Ready |
| Sterilization equipment | Ready |
| Pasteurization equipment | Ready |
| Fruiting room (3m x 3m) | In progress - final build phase |

### Fruiting Room Specifications

- **Size**: 3m x 3m (9 sqm) - correctly sized for 20-50kg/week target
- **Climate Control**: Full management of temperature, humidity, and CO2
- **Design Priority**: Easy to clean and operate solo

### Why Climate Control Matters in Darwin

Darwin's tropical climate (30-34°C wet season) presents challenges:
- High ambient temps stress some mushroom varieties
- Humidity aids fruiting but increases contamination risk
- CO2 management critical for quality (prevents leggy, pale mushrooms)

## Mushroom Varieties

### Viability Assessment for Darwin

| Mushroom | Darwin Viability | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|-------|
| Oyster (Pleurotus) | Good | Heat tolerant, fast cycles, easy entry point |
| Pink Oyster | Excellent | Loves heat, striking appearance, premium pricing |
| Lion's Mane | Challenging | Needs cooling (prefers 15-24°C) - factor in A/C costs |
| King Oyster | Moderate | Needs cooler fruiting temps |

### Recommended Start

Begin with **pink oyster and regular oyster** varieties. These tolerate Darwin's climate best and have faster cycles. Add lion's mane once climate control is dialed in and operational costs are understood.

## Sales Model

### Core Principles

- **Direct-to-consumer only** - maximum margins, no middlemen
- **Farm pickup** - zero delivery logistics
- **Set hours** - protects time, not on-call
- **No markets, restaurants, or wholesale** - simplicity over revenue maximization

### How It Works

1. Website/social media updated weekly with available stock
2. Customers purchase online
3. Pickup from farm during designated hours
4. Location advantage: Darwin is compact, 10 min drive from any suburb

### Pricing Context

- Retail direct: $25-30/kg
- Wholesale (avoided): $12-15/kg
- Starting at 5kg/week = ~$125-150/week initial revenue (validation phase)

### Customer Acquisition Strategy

Initial awareness channels:
- Local Darwin Facebook groups (gardening, local food, health/wellness)
- Instagram content showing grow process (timelapse performs well)
- Local food bloggers / health-focused accounts for word of mouth

Target: Build to 20-30 regular customers who check availability weekly, then the flywheel sustains itself.

## Documentation & SOPs

### Approach

1. **Written SOPs** - Created and maintained with Claude assistance
2. **Video documentation** - Record all key processes

### Why Video

- Easier training for any future human assistance
- Creates demonstration data potentially useful for future automation/robotics
- Visual processes are clearer than written for physical tasks

---

## Key Risks & Flags

### Single Point of Failure

One-person operation works until illness, injury, or burnout. Mitigations:
- Documented SOPs so someone else *could* step in
- Build relationship with one trusted person for emergency coverage
- Batch scheduling that ensures at least one full day off per week

### Contamination

The silent killer of mushroom operations. Addressed by:
- Proper lab setup
- Fruiting room designed for easy cleaning
- Climate control reducing contamination-favorable conditions

### Climate/Energy Costs

Lion's mane and other cool-weather varieties will require significant cooling. Monitor energy costs and factor into pricing/variety decisions.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Finish fruiting room build - protect momentum
2. **Pre-launch**: Set up simple website with availability updates
3. **Launch**: Start with 5kg/week, validate demand and refine process
4. **Document**: Begin video SOPs as you establish routines
5. **Scale gradually**: Only increase production once sales rhythm is proven

- **Reloading App** - Separate software project leveraging shooting/reloading domain expertise
- Both projects form a "barbell strategy": one foot in digital/exponential, one in physical/local
