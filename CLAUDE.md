# Mushroom Farm - Claude Project Context

## Project Summary

Small-scale gourmet mushroom farm in Darwin, Australia. Owner-operated, direct-to-consumer sales model, 20-50kg/week target capacity.

## Key Context

- **Location**: Darwin, NT, Australia (tropical climate - hot, humid)
- **Scale**: Small Giants philosophy - intentionally small, not growth-obsessed
- **Operator**: Solo operation, designed for one-person workflow
- **Sales**: Farm pickup only, no markets/restaurants/wholesale

## Infrastructure

- 3m x 3m climate-controlled fruiting room (temp, humidity, CO2)
- Full lab setup for spawn/substrate work
- Sterilization and pasteurization equipment

## Primary Varieties

- Oyster mushrooms (heat tolerant)
- Pink oyster (excellent for Darwin climate)
- Lion's mane (requires cooling - higher operational cost)

## Working Style

- Owner is learning/building iteratively
- Uses Claude for SOPs, documentation, planning
- Video documentation of processes for training (human or future automation)
